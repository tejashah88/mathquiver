Try out the example by downloading and importing [this workspace file](docs/mathquiver-example.json).

## Features
- Desmos-like equation typing experience with LaTeX support
- Can convert algebra-level equations to Excel formulas with variable replacement
- Detects missing variables and invalid Excel references
- (Should) support desktop and tablet viewing (mobile not supported)
- Can export/import workspace (as file) for later

## Quick Start
1. Enter your desired equations in the 'Equations' section.
   - You can type equations like functions (eg. `f(x)=Ax+b`), but only RHS is converted.
   - You can also add domain limits with a comma at the end (eg. `x, x < 0`).
   - Any ***orange*** borders indicate an incomplete or unparsable equation.
   - Any ***red*** borders indicate an unsupported equation for conversion.
2. Enter your desired variables in the 'Variables' section.
   - Add units in square brackets (eg. `[N/m^2]`) for clarity.
   - 'Excel Ref' contains the starting cell reference. Use **F4** to cycle through anchors ($).
   - Any ***orange*** borders indicate a missing cell reference.
   - Any ***red*** borders indicate an invalid cell reference.
3. Click the Excel file icon to copy the corresponding Excel formula (includes **=**).

### Tips
- **Only a limited subset of Excel functions are supported.**
- Drag and drop equations and variables with handle on left side.
- Snap this window to either side for a side-by-side workflow with Excel.
- Activate "Focus Mode" to hide missing variables & validation highlighting.
- To add text, type **"** (double quotes) in an empty box to enter text mode.
- To add a LaTeX expression, type **\\** (backslash) to enter LaTeX mode.
- Use the equation menu (â‰¡) to copy/paste the LaTeX expression or an image render.
- Use the Import/Export buttons to save your workspace for later.

### Known Bugs
- Variables with complex subscripts are not fully supported (`a_{n+1}+b`, `x_{y+1}^{z}`).

### Planned Features
- Add a toggle to separate variables in superscript from base variable (`W_{r}^{g}` vs. `W_{r} ^ g`)

## For developers

### Algorithms
All algorithms related to equation parsing and traversal in LaTeX or MathJSON are documented in [docs/algorithms](docs/algorithms)

### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tejashah88/mathquiver.git
cd mathquiver
npm install
```

### Running the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/mathquiver](http://localhost:3000/mathquiver) in a new browser tab.

### Creating a static site export
```bash
npm run build
```

Open `./out/index.html` in a new browser tab.
