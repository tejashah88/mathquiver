### Quick Start
1. Enter your desired equations in the 'Equations' section.
   - You can type equations with '=' like f(x)=Ax+b, but only the **right hand side** is converted.
   - Any ***orange*** borders indicate an incomplete equation.
   - Any ***red*** borders indicate an unsupported equation. **Only a limited subset of Excel functions are supported.**
2. Enter your desired variables in the 'Variables' section.
   - The 'Excel Reference' subtitle should contain the **starting** excel reference. Add anchors ($) where necessary.
3. Click the Excel file icon to copy the corresponding Excel formula.

### Tips
- You can directly copy-paste LaTeX expressions into the equations boxes.
- You can export (and import) this workspace for working on it later.
- Type starting with '\\' to type in LaTeX mode.
- You can get a LaTeX render of the equation via the "Copy Image" menu command.
